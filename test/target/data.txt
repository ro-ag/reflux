Portrait by Charles Dana Gibson, 1903
Portrait by Charles Dana Gibson, 1903
Margaret Abbott (June 15, 1878 – June 10, 1955) was an American amateur golfer and the first woman to win an Olympic event for the United States: the women's golf tournament at the 1900 Summer Olympics. Born in Calcutta in 1878, Abbott moved with her family to Chicago in 1884. She joined the Chicago Golf Club in Wheaton, Illinois, where she was coached by Charles B. Macdonald and H. J. Whigham. In 1899, she traveled with her mother to Paris to study art. The following year, along with her mother, she signed up for a women's golf tournament without realizing it was part of the second modern Olympics. Abbott won with a score of 47 strokes and was awarded a porcelain bowl; her mother tied for seventh. In December 1902, she married the writer Finley Peter Dunne. They moved to New York and had four children. Abbott died never realizing she won an Olympic event. She was not well known until University of Florida professor Paula Welch researched her life. The New York Times published her belated obituary in 2018. (Full article...)

Poster for the Seventh Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance
The Seventh Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance met in Budapest, Hungary, from 15 to 21 June 1913. As had been the case with all the preceding conferences, the location had been chosen to reflect the status of women's suffrage: a place where the prospects seemed favorable and liable to influence public sentiment by demonstrating that it was now a global movement. When it had been announced at the sixth congress (in Stockholm) that the next one would be held in the capital of Hungary, it was felt that the location seemed very remote, and there were concerns that Hungary did not have representative government. In fact, it proved to be one of the largest and most important conventions. Furthermore the delegates stopped en route for mass meetings and public banquets in Berlin, Dresden, Prague and Vienna, spreading its influence ever further afield. This poster for the conference, designed by Anna Soós Korányi and now in the collection of the French Union for Women's Suffrage, depicts a woman helping Atlas hold up a globe on his shoulders.
